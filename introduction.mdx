## What is Alter?

Alter is a dating app built around a single conviction: **swiping is broken**. It rewards snap judgements over genuine compatibility, and it puts all the emotional labour on the user.

Alter replaces the swipe with an **agent** — an AI that learns your taste, understands your vibe, and works on your behalf while you live your life.

    Every match you accept or reject teaches your agent. Over time it builds a precise model of exactly who you're looking for.

    Before a match ever reaches you, your agent and their agent hold a structured debate to verify mutual compatibility.

    Every night at 11:11 PM UTC, the matchmaker runs. Your agent has been scouting all day. Matches arrive with context, not just photos.

    When a match lands, the agent debate transcript drops into the chat. You already have something real to talk about.

## The Three Inputs

Alter's intelligence is built on three data sources collected during onboarding:

| Input | What we learn |
|---|---|
| **10 Photos** | Aesthetic archetype, visual coherence, vibe keywords |
| **Audio Interview** | Personality, communication style, life context, birth details |
| **Birth Details** | Vedic astrological profile for compatibility scoring |

## How Matching Works (in brief)

1. Your photos and interview are processed into a **3072-dimensional embedding vector** using `gemini-embedding-001`
2. Every night, the matchmaker computes **cosine similarity** between all eligible users
3. The top pairs are scored with a weighted formula: `65% vector similarity + 35% Vedic compatibility`
4. Learned constraints apply penalties to candidates that consistently don't match your taste
5. High-scoring pairs (≥ 0.80) proceed to **agent negotiation** — a structured AI debate
6. The negotiation transcript becomes your icebreaker

## Open Algorithm

Alter's matching architecture is public and open to contribution. We believe that matchmaking algorithms should be transparent, auditable, and improvable by the community.

If you have a proposal — a better scoring formula, a new compatibility signal, a bias audit — we want to hear it.
